## Design decisions

This was intended to be a TDD (Test Driven Development) project for The Odin Project. The idea being to create tests that fail prior to wtiting code that make them pass. This was a fun exercise in deciphering what actually needed to be tested at all versus either untestable or unneeded. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URSWYvyc42M) was a ton of help on making those sort of decisions.
